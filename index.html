        <h1>Javascript</h1>
        <p>In computing, JavaScript (/ˈdʒævəˌskrɪpt/) is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="op">
        <h1>Opetrators</h1>
        <p>An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.</p>
    </div>
<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.</p>

<h1>Variables Naming</h1>
<p>Naming convention (programming) In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>

<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value. Most programming languages come with a prewritten set of functions that are kept in a library.</p>

<h1>String</h1>
<p>In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation)</p>

<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods.</p>

<h1>Arguments</h1>
<p>In programming, a value that is passed between programs, subroutines or functions. Arguments are independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes. When an argument is used to customize a program for a user, it is typically called a "parameter."</p>

<h1>Parameters</h1>
<p>In computer programming, a parameter is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. [a] These pieces of data are called arguments.</p>

<h1>Return</h1>
<p>In computer programming, a return statement causes execution to leave the current subroutine and resume at the point in the code immediately after where the subroutine was called, known as its return address.</p>

<h1>Chaining methods</h1>
<p>Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.</p>

<h1>Booleans</h1>
<p>Booleans are often used in programming and in Internet search engines. Boolean expressions are expressions that result in the value of either TRUE or FALSE.</p>

<h1>Undefined</h1>
<p>In computing (particularly, in programming), undefined value is a condition where an expression does not have a correct value, although it is syntactically correct. An undefined value must not be confused with empty string, boolean "false" or other "empty" (but defined) values.</p>

<h1>NaN</h1>
<p>In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. </p>

<h1>Escape</h1>
<p>In computing and telecommunication, an escape character is a character which invokes an alternative interpretation on subsequent characters in a character sequence. An escape character is a particular case of metacharacters.</p>

<h1>Alert</h1>
<p>The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.

An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.</p>

<h1>Comments</h1>
<p>They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.</p>

<h1>jQuery</h1>
<p>jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.[3] jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, </p>

<h1>Attributes</h1>
<p>In computing, an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata.</p>
